# FITS
Flexible inference of population genetics parameters from time-series data

Motivation: With the advent of next generation sequencing techniques, it is now possible to observe evolution in action by tracking 
changes in allele frequencies in a population across time. 
Essentially, the frequency of an allele in a population depends on the following factors: 
(a) the replicative fitness of the allele as compared to the wild-type allele, 
(b) the population-wide mutation rate, and 
(c) the population size. In principle, if one has information on two of these three factors, it is possible to infer the missing one. 
Here we present a tool called FITS (Flexible Inference from Time-Series) that uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to infer the 
value of a missing factor from time-series data of allele frequencies.
